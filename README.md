# 👁️ KeratoScan AI – Early-Stage Keratoconus Detection using NASNet

KeratoScan AI is an AI-driven diagnostic tool designed to detect early-stage keratoconus—a progressive eye disease—using corneal topography images. Leveraging the NASNet deep learning architecture, this system offers accurate classification alongside a user-friendly, multi-role web interface suitable for medical professionals.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **NASNetMobile-based deep learning model** for high-accuracy classification.
- 🖼️ Upload and analyze corneal topography images in real time.
- 🧑‍⚕️ Multi-role platform: Doctor, Topographer, and IT Admin.
- 📊 Integrated patient management, report generation, and prediction storage.
- 🔐 Firebase Authentication and Firestore for secure, cloud-based data handling.
- 📈 Model Evaluation: Accuracy (95.36%), Precision (97.86%), Recall (98.15%), AUC (0.9869)
